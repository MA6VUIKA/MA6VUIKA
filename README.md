Happy New Year! I want to thank you for your help. Everyone in Natlan is grateful from the bottom of our hearts.
The road ahead is a long one, but I'm certain we can all move forward toward our goals.
What do you wish for in the New Year? If you're still undecided, treat this card as a
"Wish Token." Find me once you've made up your mind and redeem it personally.                                                   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c32bcc45-5e63-4342-a7fc-b82fda18b391)
